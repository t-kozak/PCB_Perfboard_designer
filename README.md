The **PCB Perfboard Designer** is an advanced, user-friendly web CAD application for designing and prototyping electronic circuits on virtual perfboard grids. It allows electronics engineers, makers, and hobbyists to visualize component placements, trace wire connections, and eliminate desoldering mistakes before assembling physical hardware.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✏ **Interactive Wire Tracing & Gauges**: Draw custom wire paths with selectable line thickness gauges (`2px Thin`, `4px Normal`, `7px Thick`).
- 📦 **Integrated Circuits (ICs) Catalog & Editor**: Place built-in chips (`NE555 Timer`, `DIP-14 Logic`, `ATmega328P`) or open the **IC Editor** to create custom chips with dynamic pin labels.
- 🎨 **Visual 2D Color Selector & LocalStorage Palette**: Click and drag across a 2D color spectrum box with rainbow hue slider to pick active wire colors. Save custom color swatches permanently to `localStorage`.
- ⛶ **Fullscreen Focus Mode & Widescreen Auto-Fit**: Expand the canvas workspace to `100vw` × `100vh` for distraction-free designing. Includes auto-fit scale calculation (`🎯 Fit`) to display large boards (`30×20`, `40×30`, `50×50`) with zero scrollbars.
- 🖱 **Middle Mouse Button Board Panning**: Pan across large perfboard grids by holding the middle mouse wheel button and dragging.
- 🔍 **Smooth Board Zooming**: Zoom in and out smoothly from `20%` up to `300%` using `Ctrl + Mouse Wheel` or dedicated zoom buttons.
- 💾 **Full Progress & Project File Persistence**: Save your progress locally (`Save Progress`) or export/import complete circuit designs as JSON project files (`Save Project` / `Load Project`).
- 🛠 **Dedicated Tool Modes**: Toggle between `🖐 Select` (inspection only), `✏ Wire`, `🧹 Eraser`, and `📝 Note` annotation modes.
- 🖱 **Right-Click Context Menu**: Quick access to color changes, text note editing, and component deletion.
